# Installation

As `deerlay` is not yet available on PyPI, you can install it directly from the source by following these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    Download the source code by cloning the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PRFina/deerlay.git
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
    Create a virtual environment using your preferred tool (e.g., `venv`, `virtualenv`, or `conda`):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
    Then activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install the Package**
    Finally, install the package from the source using `pip`:
    ```bash
    cd deerlay
    pip install .
    ```
